Favour composition over inheritence. Can it be refactored?</p>
<p>In ruby there are very few times when we try to only use inheritance when there are clearly related reusable pieces of code that fit under a single common concept. We prefer to build up our code using modules. <a class="resource-link" href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex44.html">Chris Pine has a great chapter on Inheritence vs Composition.</a>
